## Business Objective
- The data given contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not.
- The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) . Thus, we have to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
- When a person applies for a loan, there are two types of decisions that could be taken by the company:
* Loan accepted:
If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:
* Fully paid:
Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate)
* Current:
Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed. These candidates are not labelled as 'defaulted'.
* Charged-off:
Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan
